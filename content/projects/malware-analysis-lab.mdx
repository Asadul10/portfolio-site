# Project Overview

A comprehensive malware analysis laboratory designed for safe and effective analysis of malicious software. The lab provides isolated environments, automated analysis tools, and comprehensive reporting capabilities for security researchers and incident response teams.

## Lab Architecture

### Network Isolation
- **Air-gapped network** with no internet connectivity
- **VLAN segmentation** for different analysis environments
- **Firewall rules** to prevent lateral movement
- **Network monitoring** for traffic analysis

### Virtual Environment
- **VMware vSphere** for virtualization
- **Isolated VMs** for different malware families
- **Snapshot management** for quick restoration
- **Resource allocation** based on analysis needs

## Analysis Tools

### Automated Sandbox
- **Cuckoo Sandbox** for automated analysis
- **Custom Python scripts** for data extraction
- **Behavioral analysis** and monitoring
- **Screenshot capture** at key intervals

### Static Analysis
- **YARA rules** for pattern matching
- **PE analysis** tools for Windows executables
- **String extraction** and analysis
- **Entropy calculation** for packed files

### Dynamic Analysis
- **API monitoring** with API Monitor
- **Registry monitoring** for persistence mechanisms
- **File system monitoring** for artifacts
- **Network traffic capture** and analysis

## YARA Rules Development

Created custom YARA rules for common malware families:

```yara
rule Trojan_Generic {
    meta:
        description = "Generic trojan detection"
        author = "Asadul Islam Arif"
        date = "2024-01-15"
    
    strings:
        $s1 = "CreateProcess" ascii
        $s2 = "WriteFile" ascii
        $s3 = "RegSetValue" ascii
        $s4 = "InternetOpen" ascii
    
    condition:
        3 of them
}
```

## Analysis Workflow

### 1. Sample Intake
- Secure file transfer to isolated environment
- Initial hash calculation and database logging
- Preliminary static analysis
- Risk assessment and categorization

### 2. Sandbox Analysis
- Automated execution in controlled environment
- Behavioral monitoring and data collection
- Screenshot and video capture
- Network traffic analysis

### 3. Manual Analysis
- Deep dive into suspicious behaviors
- Code analysis and reverse engineering
- IOCs (Indicators of Compromise) extraction
- Threat intelligence correlation

### 4. Reporting
- Automated report generation
- IOC sharing in standard formats
- Remediation recommendations
- Knowledge base updates

## Security Measures

### Lab Isolation
- **Physical air-gap** from production networks
- **Dedicated hardware** for analysis work
- **Secure file transfer** protocols only
- **Regular environment resets** to prevent persistence

### Data Protection
- **Encrypted storage** for analysis data
- **Access controls** and audit logging
- **Secure deletion** of sensitive data
- **Backup and recovery** procedures
