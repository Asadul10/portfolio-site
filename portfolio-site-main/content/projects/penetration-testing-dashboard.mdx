# Project Overview

A full-stack web application designed to streamline penetration testing workflows and vulnerability management. The dashboard provides security professionals with tools to organize, track, and report on security assessments efficiently.

## Key Features

### Project Management
- Create and organize penetration testing projects
- Track project status and timelines
- Assign team members and roles
- Document project scope and objectives

### Vulnerability Tracking
- Real-time vulnerability discovery and logging
- Severity classification and risk assessment
- Evidence collection and proof-of-concept storage
- Remediation tracking and verification

### Report Generation
- Automated report templates
- Customizable report sections
- Export to multiple formats (PDF, HTML, Word)
- Executive summary generation

## Technical Stack

### Frontend
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Framer Motion** for animations
- **React Query** for data fetching
- **Zustand** for state management

### Backend
- **Node.js** with Express
- **MongoDB** with Mongoose
- **JWT** authentication
- **Multer** for file uploads
- **Puppeteer** for PDF generation

### Security Features
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting and CSRF protection
- Secure file upload handling
- Audit logging

## Architecture

The application follows a microservices architecture with:

- **API Gateway** for request routing
- **Authentication Service** for user management
- **Project Service** for project operations
- **Vulnerability Service** for security data
- **Report Service** for document generation

## Database Design

```javascript
// Project Schema
const ProjectSchema = new Schema({
  name: { type: String, required: true },
  description: String,
  status: { type: String, enum: ['planning', 'active', 'completed'] },
  startDate: Date,
  endDate: Date,
  team: [{ type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User' }],
  vulnerabilities: [{ type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Vulnerability' }]
});

// Vulnerability Schema
const VulnerabilitySchema = new Schema({
  title: { type: String, required: true },
  description: String,
  severity: { type: String, enum: ['critical', 'high', 'medium', 'low'] },
  status: { type: String, enum: ['open', 'in-progress', 'resolved'] },
  evidence: [String], // File paths
  remediation: String,
  project: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Project' }
});
```

## API Endpoints

### Projects
- `GET /api/projects` - List all projects
- `POST /api/projects` - Create new project
- `GET /api/projects/:id` - Get project details
- `PUT /api/projects/:id` - Update project
- `DELETE /api/projects/:id` - Delete project

### Vulnerabilities
- `GET /api/vulnerabilities` - List vulnerabilities
- `POST /api/vulnerabilities` - Create vulnerability
- `PUT /api/vulnerabilities/:id` - Update vulnerability
- `DELETE /api/vulnerabilities/:id` - Delete vulnerability

### Reports
- `POST /api/reports/generate` - Generate report
- `GET /api/reports/:id/download` - Download report

## Security Considerations

- All API endpoints require authentication
- Input validation using Joi schemas
- File upload restrictions and virus scanning
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- XSS protection with content security policies
- Regular security audits and dependency updates

## Performance Optimizations

- Database indexing for fast queries
- Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Image optimization and lazy loading
- Code splitting and bundle optimization
- CDN integration for static assets

## Deployment

The application is deployed using:
- **Frontend**: Vercel for static hosting
- **Backend**: Railway for API hosting
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas
- **File Storage**: AWS S3
- **Monitoring**: Sentry for error tracking

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with vulnerability scanners
- Automated vulnerability detection
- Machine learning for risk assessment
- Mobile application
- Advanced reporting features
- Team collaboration tools

## Notes & Learnings

This project provided valuable experience in:

- Building secure web applications from scratch
- Implementing proper authentication and authorization
- Designing scalable database schemas
- Creating intuitive user interfaces for complex data
- Integrating multiple services and APIs
- Following security best practices throughout development

The dashboard has been successfully used in real penetration testing engagements, significantly improving efficiency and organization of security assessments.
