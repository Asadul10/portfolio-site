# Project Overview

This comprehensive network security lab demonstrates the implementation of Access Control Lists (ACLs) and VTY line hardening to secure remote access in a multi-router Cisco environment. The project focuses on protecting network infrastructure from unauthorized access while maintaining operational efficiency.

## Objectives

- Configure extended ACLs to control traffic flow
- Implement VTY line security with access-class restrictions
- Set up secure transport protocols (SSH over Telnet)
- Test and verify security configurations
- Document the hardening process

## Technical Implementation

### ACL Configuration

The lab implements both standard and extended ACLs to control traffic:

```cisco
! Extended ACL for web traffic
access-list 100 permit tcp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 80
access-list 100 permit tcp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 443
access-list 100 deny ip any any

! Apply to interface
interface GigabitEthernet0/0/1.47
 ip access-group 100 in
```

### VTY Security

Secure remote access configuration:

```cisco
! VTY line configuration
line vty 0 4
 access-class 10 in
 transport input ssh
 login local
 exec-timeout 5 0
```

## Security Features

- **Traffic Filtering**: Granular control over network traffic
- **Access Restrictions**: Limited VTY access to specific networks
- **Protocol Security**: SSH encryption for remote management
- **Session Timeouts**: Automatic disconnection for idle sessions
- **Authentication**: Local user authentication for VTY access

## Results

Successfully implemented network security measures that:
- Blocked unauthorized traffic while allowing legitimate services
- Secured remote access with proper authentication
- Maintained network performance and reliability
- Provided comprehensive logging and monitoring

## Notes & Learnings

This project reinforced the importance of defense-in-depth strategies in network security. Key takeaways include:

- ACL placement significantly impacts performance and security
- VTY hardening is crucial for preventing unauthorized access
- Regular testing and verification ensure configurations work as intended
- Documentation is essential for maintaining security posture

The lab provided hands-on experience with Cisco security features and demonstrated practical approaches to network hardening in enterprise environments.
